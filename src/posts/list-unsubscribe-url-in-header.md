title: List-Unsubscribe URL in Header

I just found that the list unsubscribe URL could be in the email header.

I was trying to unsubscribe from a mailing list that I knew, but I couldn't find the unsubscribe button or link in the email. I poked around and found the unsubscribe URL in the email header. I visited that URL and it seemed to work well.

That being said, I strongly recommend *not* clicking on the unsubscribe link or button from an email that you don't know, because the URL may be phishing you.

If you know the sender and really need to uncover the unsubscribe URL, you might want to dig into menu items like "email properties", "email details", "show header", etc.
