<p><span class="pull-A">A</span>s a new­bie in<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>eb de­sign and ty­pog­ra­phy, I<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as try­ing to ap­ply small<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>aps to ab­bre­vi­a­tions in the texts. I knew the fol­low­ing<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>ode:</p>
<pre><code class="language-CSS">.small-caps {
    font-variant: small-caps;
}

<p>However, it did­n’t<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ork for the ab­bre­vi­a­tions<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>hich are all up­per­case let­ters. I thought it<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>aused by the font since I<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>ould ap­ply small<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>aps to the nav­i­ga­tion bar, but<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>hang­ing the font for the texts<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as not help­ful.<span class="push-A"></span> <span class="pull-A">A</span>fter some dig­ging around I found that I need to trans­form the up­per­case let­ters into low­er­case first. In<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>ther<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ords, I need:</p>
<pre><code class="language-CSS">.small-caps {
    text-transform: lowercase;
    font-variant: small-caps;
}
</code></pre>
<p>By the<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ay, I did­n’t use small<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>aps<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>n ab­bre­vi­a­tions in the end. It felt un­nat­ural. I think the best<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>p­tion<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ould be us­ing a na­tive small<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>aps font in­stead, but a match­ing<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>ne has to be found first.</p>

<p>I<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as us­ing an in­line <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> for the logo. I set the height to be a fixed<span class="push-v"></span> <span class="pull-v">v</span>alue, and the<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>idth to be<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>auto” hop­ing that it<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ould scale prop­erly. I<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as also us­ing the flex lay­out<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ith<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>justify-content” set to<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>space-between”. My in­ten­tion<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as to put the logo at the left-most po­si­tion<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ithin the header and the nav­i­ga­tion bar at right-most. However, dif­fer­ent browsers ren­der this dif­fer­ently. If I’m re­mem­ber­ing it<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>or­rectly,<span class="push-C"></span> <span class="pull-C">C</span>hrome and Firefox be­haved<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>or­rectly<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>hile Safari and <span class="small-caps">IE</span> had some is­sues. In Safari and <span class="small-caps">IE</span>, the<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>idth<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>f the logo<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as much larger. It looked like the logo<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as tak­ing up the space that<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>rig­i­nally the sep­a­ra­tor since the<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>idth<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as set to<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>auto”.</p>
<p>It’s sim­ple to solve this is­sue. Just don’t use<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>auto” and man­u­ally set the<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>or­rect<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>idth.</p>
<p><span class="pull-A">A</span>s al­ways, I’m new to<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>eb de­sign and I prob­a­bly saw this is­sue due to some bad de­sign prac­tice.</p>
