#### Simple Event Logger

A simple web application for logging events. Currently, it supports logging the date time, name, and memo of an event. The intended use case is for a single user to deploy it in a private network. The [backend](https://github.com/zzpxyx/simple-event-logger-service) is using Express.js and TypeScript, and the [frontend](https://github.com/zzpxyx/simple-event-logger-ui) is React and TypeScript via Vite.

#### [Date Calc](https://github.com/zzpxyx/date-calc)

A simple TypeScript/JavaScript library for calculating the period between two dates. It is also the name of the [live demo](https://zzpxyx.github.io/date-calc).

#### [SubPlayer](https://github.com/zzpxyx/subplayer)

A simple subtitle player. It overlaps the video on the screen and plays the given subtitle file with sync and speed controls.
