        <p><a href="https://highlightjs.org/">Highlight.js</a> is a popular library for syntax highlighting. I just figured out how to use its CDN version.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://highlightjs.org/download/">download instructions</a>, there is a hosted version of highlight.js. It is a prebuilt version with 23 commonly used languages. I was trying to highlight Vim script, which was not included. After searching on the Internet, I found it on <a href="https://cdnjs.com/libraries/highlight.js/">cdnjs</a>. Every supporting language was listed, so I downloaded the one for Vim script (languages/vim.min.js) immediately and started testing. It was not working because &quot;hljs&quot; was not defined.</p>
<p>It took me a while to realize the structure of those js files. The one I downloaded for Vim script was merely an addon. In other words, I still needed the file highlight.min.js as a base. After referencing both of them, Vim script highlighting finally worked.</p>
