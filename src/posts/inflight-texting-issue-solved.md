title: In-flight Texting Issue Solved

I just found a tiny catch in sending in-flight Wi-Fi messages, and luckily I figured out what was wrong.

I was using T-Mobile's free in-flight texting the other day, but it didn't work as before. The progress bar on top of the iPhone stopped in the middle and got stuck.

It took me a while to realize what was wrong. It was because the text was sent as an iMessage, but the in-flight Wi-Fi texting actually required the text to be sent as a normal SMS. I thought this switching should have happened automatically, but it didn't for some reason.

Solving this issue is also easy. Just long press the message bubble and choose "Send as Text Message". Or just turn off iMessage temporarily. However, turning back on iMessage might take quite a while, according to my testing.
