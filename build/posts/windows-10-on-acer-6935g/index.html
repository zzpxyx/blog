        <p>Finally, I man­aged to up­grade to Windows 10 for my <em>8-year-old</em> lap­top. I know, I know, I’m ask­ing for trou­ble.</p>
<p>It all started with an er­ror mes­sage last year. Nowadays, I sel­dom use the lap­top as I have a much more pow­er­ful desk­top (which is, well, nearly 5 years old). But when I do, I up­grade the op­er­at­ing sys­tem. I thought that it would be a piece of cake like up­grad­ing to Windows 10 on my desk­top ma­chine, so I was shocked to see an er­ror mes­sage say­ing that my lap­top <span class="small-caps">CPU</span> was not sup­ported. No, no, no, lit­tle up­grade as­sis­tant, my Acer <span class="small-caps">6935G</span> has Intel Core 2 Duo <span class="small-caps">P8600</span> proces­sor, which has all the fea­tures you want. <span class="small-caps">PAE</span>, check. <span class="small-caps">SSE2</span>, check. <span class="small-caps">NX</span>, check. What else do you need? I searched all over the Internet, but I did­n’t find too much use­ful in­for­ma­tion, which was not a sur­prise con­sid­er­ing the age of my lap­top.</p>
<p>Frankly speak­ing, I was not very fas­ci­nated with Windows 10. Had I stopped right here, I would have much less trou­ble. However, I sim­ply did­n’t (or could­n’t). To me, this was a chal­leng­ing puz­zle and I re­ally en­joyed try­ing to solve it.</p>
<p>One piece of in­for­ma­tion did give me some in­spi­ra­tion, but it was also a trap, well, kind of. It said that <span class="small-caps">NX</span> could have been dis­abled by <span class="small-caps">BIOS</span>, and it might re­quire a <span class="small-caps">BIOS</span> up­date or hack to see the hid­den op­tions. I was not sur­prised at all to see that my<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>up-to-date” <span class="small-caps">BIOS</span> did­n’t have that op­tion. Let’s try <span class="small-caps">BIOS</span> hack, I thought.</p>
<p>I was lucky to find an old <a href="https://www.bios-mods.com/forum/Thread-UNLOCKED-ACER-6935G">un­locked ver­sion</a> of my <span class="small-caps">BIOS</span>. I was ex­cited to see the hid­den menu for ad­vanced op­tions, but I did­n’t see an op­tion for <span class="small-caps">NX</span>. As a side find­ing, I saw the op­tion for VT-x. I turned it on, but <a href="https://www.grc.com/securable.htm">SecurAble</a> still showed<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span><span class="small-caps">NO</span><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">”</span> for hard­ware vir­tu­al­iza­tion. It seemed that the hid­den menu was un­cov­ered, but that op­tion for VT-x was not work­ing for some rea­son.</p>
<p>I kept look­ing for other un­locked ver­sions, but I did­n’t find any suit­able one. I even flashed a wrong im­age of <span class="small-caps">BIOS</span>. Guess what? My lap­top turned into a brick. Not sur­prised at all. Long story short: I had to tear apart the lap­top, des­ol­der the <span class="small-caps">BIOS</span> chip, re-pro­gram it, re-sol­der it, and then re­assem­ble the lap­top. Lessons learned: never flash a <span class="small-caps">BIOS</span> im­age if its size is dif­fer­ent than the of­fi­cial one.</p>
<p>A year passed by quickly. Recently, I came across <a href="https://marcan.st/2009/06/enabling-intel-vt-on-the-aspire-8930g/">this post</a>. It is talk­ing about en­abling VT-x on Acer <span class="small-caps">8930G</span>, which is a model very sim­i­lar to my <span class="small-caps">6935G</span>. I thought that a suc­cess in en­abling VT-x would be a good step to­wards <span class="small-caps">NX</span>, so I gave it a try. Basically, I dumped out the run­time <span class="small-caps">BIOS</span> us­ing an Ubuntu Live <span class="small-caps">USB</span> stick, used the script in that post to patch the im­age, and then flash it back (with size check­ing first, of course). This time SecurAble re­ports<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span><span class="small-caps">YES</span><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">”</span> for VT-x. Nice. Let’s see if we can turn on <span class="small-caps">NX</span>.</p>
<p>By the way, I launched Windows 10 up­grade pro­gram when­ever I made some changes, but it al­ways failed. Up till then, I had no luck.</p>
<p>I did­n’t ex­pect it when I came upon <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/39ckik/cpu_not_compatible_with_windows_10_upgrade/cttcked">this post</a> dur­ing Internet search­ing. The post men­tions a Windows sys­tem set­ting that turns <em>off</em> <span class="small-caps">NX</span>. Guess which one? Surprise! It’s the <span class="small-caps">DEP</span> set­ting! I had seen that set­ting for a mil­lion times, but I never re­al­ized that it would af­fect <span class="small-caps">NX</span>. I was as­ton­ished to see that Windows 10 started to up­grade with­out er­rors af­ter this. What? Why? No! Yes!</p>
<p>Actually, that <span class="small-caps">DEP</span> set­ting might be the <em>only</em> step I need. Anyway, I did it.</p>
<p>Hopefully from my story, you can get some in­spi­ra­tion. Or amuse­ment.</p>
