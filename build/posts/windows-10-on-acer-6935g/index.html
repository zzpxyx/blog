        <p>Finally, I man­aged to up­grade to<span class="push-W"></span> <span class="pull-W">W</span>indows 10 for my <em>8-year-old</em> lap­top. I know, I know, I’m ask­ing for trou­ble.</p>
<p>It all started<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ith an er­ror mes­sage last year. Nowadays, I sel­dom use the lap­top as I have a much more pow­er­ful desk­top (which is,<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ell, nearly 5 years<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>ld). But<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>hen I do, I up­grade the<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>p­er­at­ing sys­tem. I thought that it<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ould be a piece<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>f<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>ake like up­grad­ing to<span class="push-W"></span> <span class="pull-W">W</span>indows 10<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>n my desk­top ma­chine, so I<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as shocked to see an er­ror mes­sage say­ing that my lap­top <span class="small-caps">CPU</span> <span class="push-w"></span><span class="pull-w">w</span>as not sup­ported. No, no, no, lit­tle up­grade as­sis­tant, my<span class="push-A"></span> <span class="pull-A">A</span>cer <span class="small-caps">6935G</span> has Intel<span class="push-C"></span> <span class="pull-C">C</span>ore 2 Duo <span class="small-caps">P8600</span> proces­sor,<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>hich has all the fea­tures you<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ant. <span class="small-caps">PAE</span>,<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>heck. <span class="small-caps">SSE2</span>,<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>heck. <span class="small-caps">NX</span>,<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>heck.<span class="push-W"></span> <span class="pull-W">W</span>hat else do you need? I searched all<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>ver the Internet, but I did­n’t find too much use­ful in­for­ma­tion,<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>hich<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as not a sur­prise<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>on­sid­er­ing the age<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>f my lap­top.</p>
<p>Frankly speak­ing, I<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as not<span class="push-v"></span> <span class="pull-v">v</span>ery fas­ci­nated<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ith<span class="push-W"></span> <span class="pull-W">W</span>indows 10. Had I stopped right here, I<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ould have much less trou­ble. However, I sim­ply did­n’t (or<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>ould­n’t).<span class="push-T"></span> <span class="pull-T">T</span>o me, this<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as a<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>hal­leng­ing puz­zle and I re­ally en­joyed try­ing to solve it.</p>
<p><span class="pull-O">O</span>ne piece<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>f in­for­ma­tion did give me some in­spi­ra­tion, but it<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as also a trap,<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ell, kind<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>f. It said that <span class="small-caps">NX</span> <span class="push-c"></span><span class="pull-c">c</span>ould have been dis­abled by <span class="small-caps">BIOS</span>, and it might re­quire a <span class="small-caps">BIOS</span> up­date<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>r hack to see the hid­den<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>p­tions. I<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as not sur­prised at all to see that my<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>up-to-date” <span class="small-caps">BIOS</span> did­n’t have that<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>p­tion. Let’s try <span class="small-caps">BIOS</span> hack, I thought.</p>
<p>I<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as lucky to find an<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>ld <a href="https://www.bios-mods.com/forum/Thread-UNLOCKED-ACER-6935G">un­locked<span class="push-v"></span> <span class="pull-v">v</span>er­sion</a> <span class="push-o"></span><span class="pull-o">o</span>f my <span class="small-caps">BIOS</span>. I<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as ex­cited to see the hid­den menu for ad­vanced<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>p­tions, but I did­n’t see an<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>p­tion for <span class="small-caps">NX</span>.<span class="push-A"></span> <span class="pull-A">A</span>s a side find­ing, I saw the<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>p­tion for<span class="push-V"></span> <span class="pull-V">V</span>T-x. I turned it<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>n, but <a href="https://www.grc.com/securable.htm">SecurAble</a> still showed<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span><span class="small-caps">NO</span><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">”</span> for hard­ware<span class="push-v"></span> <span class="pull-v">v</span>ir­tu­al­iza­tion. It seemed that the hid­den menu<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as un­cov­ered, but that<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>p­tion for<span class="push-V"></span> <span class="pull-V">V</span>T-x<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as not<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ork­ing for some rea­son.</p>
<p>I kept look­ing for<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>ther un­locked<span class="push-v"></span> <span class="pull-v">v</span>er­sions, but I did­n’t find any suit­able<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>ne. I even flashed a<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>rong im­age<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>f <span class="small-caps">BIOS</span>. Guess<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>hat? My lap­top turned into a brick. Not sur­prised at all. Long story short: I had to tear apart the lap­top, des­ol­der the <span class="small-caps">BIOS</span> <span class="push-c"></span><span class="pull-c">c</span>hip, re-pro­gram it, re-sol­der it, and then re­assem­ble the lap­top. Lessons learned: never flash a <span class="small-caps">BIOS</span> im­age if its size is dif­fer­ent than the<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>f­fi­cial<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>ne.</p>
<p><span class="pull-A">A</span> year passed by quickly. Recently, I<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>ame across <a href="https://marcan.st/2009/06/enabling-intel-vt-on-the-aspire-8930g/">this post</a>. It is talk­ing about en­abling<span class="push-V"></span> <span class="pull-V">V</span>T-x<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>n<span class="push-A"></span> <span class="pull-A">A</span>cer <span class="small-caps">8930G</span>,<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>hich is a model<span class="push-v"></span> <span class="pull-v">v</span>ery sim­i­lar to my <span class="small-caps">6935G</span>. I thought that a suc­cess in en­abling<span class="push-V"></span> <span class="pull-V">V</span>T-x<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ould be a good step to­wards <span class="small-caps">NX</span>, so I gave it a try. Basically, I dumped<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>ut the run­time <span class="small-caps">BIOS</span> us­ing an Ubuntu Live <span class="small-caps">USB</span> stick, used the script in that post to patch the im­age, and then flash it back (with size<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>heck­ing first,<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>f<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>ourse).<span class="push-T"></span> <span class="pull-T">T</span>his time SecurAble re­ports<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span><span class="small-caps">YES</span><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">”</span> for<span class="push-V"></span> <span class="pull-V">V</span>T-x. Nice. Let’s see if<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>e<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>an turn<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>n <span class="small-caps">NX</span>.</p>
<p>By the<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ay, I launched<span class="push-W"></span> <span class="pull-W">W</span>indows 10 up­grade pro­gram<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>hen­ever I made some<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>hanges, but it al­ways failed. Up till then, I had no luck.</p>
<p>I did­n’t ex­pect it<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>hen I<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>ame upon <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/39ckik/cpu_not_compatible_with_windows_10_upgrade/cttcked">this post</a> dur­ing Internet search­ing.<span class="push-T"></span> <span class="pull-T">T</span>he post men­tions a<span class="push-W"></span> <span class="pull-W">W</span>indows sys­tem set­ting that turns <em><span class="push-o"></span><span class="pull-o">o</span>ff</em> <span class="small-caps">NX</span>. Guess<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>hich<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>ne? Surprise! It’s the <span class="small-caps">DEP</span> set­ting! I had seen that set­ting for a mil­lion times, but I never re­al­ized that it<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ould af­fect <span class="small-caps">NX</span>. I<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as as­ton­ished to see that<span class="push-W"></span> <span class="pull-W">W</span>indows 10 started to up­grade<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ith­out er­rors af­ter this.<span class="push-W"></span> <span class="pull-W">W</span>hat?<span class="push-W"></span> <span class="pull-W">W</span>hy? No!<span class="push-Y"></span> <span class="pull-Y">Y</span>es!</p>
<p><span class="pull-A">A</span>ctually, that <span class="small-caps">DEP</span> set­ting might be the <em><span class="push-o"></span><span class="pull-o">o</span>nly</em> step I need.<span class="push-A"></span> <span class="pull-A">A</span>nyway, I did it.</p>
<p>Hopefully from my story, you<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>an get some in­spi­ra­tion.<span class="push-O"></span> <span class="pull-O">O</span>r amuse­ment.</p>
