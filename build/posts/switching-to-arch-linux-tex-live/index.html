        <h2>Switching to Arch Linux TeX Live</h2>

        <p>I’ve just switched my TeX Live distribution from the official one to the one on the Arch Linux repository.</p>
<p>I was just updating the packages routinely on Arch Linux, and I noticed that Texmaker now requires <code>texlive-core</code>, which in turn requires <code>texlive-bin</code>. This was problematic for me since I had already installed the official TeX Live distribution. This not only took more disk space, but also broke the functionality. For example, I was no longer able to compile my resume. My guess was that the new install somehow affected the TeX Live file tree and some style files were considered missing.</p>
<p>Up to this point, I had two options. I could uninstall Texmaker and its TeX Live dependencies, then reinstall Texmaker from another source and use it with the existing official TeX Live distribution on my machine. Alternatively, I could uninstall the official distribution and switch to the Arch Linux packaged version of TeX Live. Either option should work. I was just curious about the latter option, so I chose to give it a try. In addition, I had already changed my resume template to <a href="https://github.com/zzpxyx/two-column-resume">my custom one</a> long time ago, and it no longer needed unofficial fonts or stuff, so switching to another TeX Live distribution would only require installing missing CTAN packages.</p>
<p>First of all, I uninstalled the official distribution by:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-shell">tlmgr uninstall --all
</code></pre>
<p>There were some errors about write permission, but I did some quick check and the errors seemed benign. Then I installed <code>texlive-latexextra</code> for some commonly used LaTeX packages. After that, I tried to compile my resume and saw that some fonts were missing as expected. A quick search showed that I should install <code>texlive-fontsextra</code>. It would take over 1 GB of disk space since it included tons of fonts. I’m not a fan of this, so I chose to use <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/TeX_Live#tllocalmgr">tllocalmgr</a> to manually install missing CTAN packages. After some trial and error, I ended up with installing these CTAN packages: <code>raleway</code>, <code>mweights</code>, <code>droid</code>, <code>fontawesome</code>, and <code>ly1</code>. However, no PDF file was generated at the end of compile, and Texmaker didn’t report any obvious error. The log did show that some fonts were missing. <code>tllocalmgr</code> mentioned that I should check its log and modify the <code>updmap.cfg</code> file as needed. After some trial and error again, I found that I would need to add the font maps like below for the fonts mentioned in the <code>tllocalmgr</code> log file.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-shell">updmap-sys --enable Map=Raleway.map
updmap-sys --enable Map=droidsans.map
updmap-sys --enable Map=droidsansmono.map
updmap-sys --enable Map=droidserif.map
updmap-sys --enable Map=fontawesome.map
</code></pre>
<p>I’m still a newbie for TeX Live, so what I did here may not be the best practice. After that, the compile worked and generated a PDF file.</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://pypi.org/project/diff-pdf-visually/">diff-pdf-visually</a> to compare the two PDF files from the two TeX Live distributions, and the tool reported no visual difference. I would take this as a sign of victory. If I’m understanding it correctly, I would no long need to upgrade TeX Live like <a href="../upgrading-tex-live">my previous post</a>.</p>
