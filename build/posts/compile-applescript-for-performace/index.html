        <p>Recently, I’ve found that compiling an AppleScript file may help with its performance.</p>
<p>I have this arguably weird workflow on a Mac where I can press Command+2 and Command+3 to switch to specific applications. I didn’t find any open source solution for it, so I had to create some custom AppleScripts and bind them to global hotkeys in Karabiner-Elements. The setup worked for me until I upgraded to macOS Catalina, where the performance of the scripts was noticeably degraded. I had to wait for a few seconds before the application switching to the foreground.</p>
<p>I have to use the command <code>osascript</code> to run my custom AppleScript when the designated hotkey is triggered. I was reading its manual for some inspirations, and I actually found one at the bottom of the man page: <code>osacompile</code>, which can compile AppleScripts. I gave it a try using <code>osacompile -x</code> which is said to save the resulting script as execute only.  It didn’t let me down. The execution performance of my script was improved drastically.</p>
<p>This is not the end of the story though. I’ve noticed that although the performance is improved in general, it doesn’t eliminate the problem. Sometimes I still have to wait for a while for the script to finish. My guess is that something about AppleScript is changed in macOS Catalina, like the script interpretor or the built-in script functions. Maybe something about intercepting keyboard inputs is also changed so that Karabiner-Elements is slowed down.</p>
<p>That said, the general idea here may be helpful in certain cases. Maybe the next time when I’m dealing with scripts, I’ll remember to check if there is a way to compile them.</p>
