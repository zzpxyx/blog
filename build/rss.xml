<p>I’m us­ing the<span class="push-A"></span> <span class="pull-A">A</span>rc Darker theme. I’ve<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>on­fig­ured the task list to<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>nly show<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>in­dow but­tons so that they take less space in the top-right<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>or­ner<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>f the screen and play<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ell<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ith the ti­tle bar<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>hen a<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>in­dow is max­i­mized. I al­ways feel that the icons in the<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>in­dow but­tons are too small.</p>
<p><span class="pull-T">T</span>he key to solve this prob­lem is to fig­ure<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>ut<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>hich style is ap­plied to the<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>in­dow but­tons. I know lit­tle about <span class="small-caps">GTK</span> themes, so here is my guess­ing and<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>b­ser­va­tions through trial and er­ror.</p>
<p>For the<span class="push-A"></span> <span class="pull-A">A</span>rc Darker theme, the base theme file<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>n my<span class="push-A"></span> <span class="pull-A">A</span>rch Linux is</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">/usr/share/themes/Arc-Darker/gtk-2.0/gtkrc
</code></pre>
<p>Looking at the<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>on­tent<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>f the file, it in­cludes<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>ther theme files.<span class="push-O"></span> <span class="pull-O">O</span>ne<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>f them is <code>panel.rc</code>,<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>hich seems promis­ing.</p>
<p><span class="pull-A">A</span>t the end<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>f <code>panel.rc</code>, there is a line that says</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">widget "*XfceTasklist*" style "panelbuttons"
</code></pre>
<p>I think this is<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>hat<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>e need. Looking at the <code>panelButtons</code> style in the same file, <code>xthickness</code> is set to 4. I’m not ex­actly sure<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>hat this prop­erty means, but it seems that it is used for<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>al­cu­lat­ing<span class="push-v"></span> <span class="pull-v">v</span>ar­i­ous padding spaces. I<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>hange it to 2, and the icons im­me­di­ately ap­pear larger af­ter switch­ing to an­other theme and back.<span class="push-T"></span> <span class="pull-T">T</span>he smaller that<span class="push-v"></span> <span class="pull-v">v</span>alue is, the larger the icons<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ill be.</p>
<p><span class="pull-T">T</span>his so­lu­tion has many draw­backs. For ex­am­ple, the mod­i­fi­ca­tion may be<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>ver­rid­den if I up­date the<span class="push-A"></span> <span class="pull-A">A</span>rc theme pack­age. For now, that’s good enough for me.</p>

<p>I<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as try­ing to<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>om­pile a LaTeX doc­u­ment us­ing a<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>us­tomized<span class="push-T"></span> <span class="pull-T">T</span>eX Live 2016.<span class="push-T"></span> <span class="pull-T">T</span>here<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as an er­ror mes­sage about miss­ing <code>bbm.sty</code>. Naively, I thought in­stalling the bbm pack­age<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ould solve the prob­lem. I tried, but the same er­ror mes­sage ap­peared again.</p>
<p><span class="pull-A">A</span>fter search­ing around, I got a hint about the bbm-macros pack­age. I gave it a try by sim­ply in­stalling it, and it<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>orked per­fectly. It seems that the bbm pack­age in­cludes the fonts, and the bbm-macros pack­age is for LaTeX sup­port.</p>
<p><span class="pull-A">A</span>nother les­son learned is about the search<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>p­tions in<span class="push-T"></span> <span class="pull-T">T</span>eX Live Manager. I<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as us­ing the fol­low­ing line to search for bbm-re­lated pack­ages af­ter in­stalling the bbm pack­age, and the re­sult<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>nly showed bbm.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">tlmgr search bbm

<p>Later I learned that this<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ould<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>nly search for the <em>in­stalled</em> pack­ages.<span class="push-T"></span> <span class="pull-T">T</span>o also search for unin­stalled pack­ages, I should have used this:</p>

I know, I know, I’m ask­ing for trou­ble.</p>
<p>It all started<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ith an er­ror mes­sage last year. Nowadays, I sel­dom use the lap­top as I have a much more pow­er­ful desk­top (which is,<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ell, nearly 5 years<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>ld). But<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>hen I do, I up­grade the<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>p­er­at­ing sys­tem. I thought that it<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ould be a piece<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>f<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>ake like up­grad­ing to<span class="push-W"></span> <span class="pull-W">W</span>indows 10<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>n my desk­top ma­chine, so I<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as shocked to see an er­ror mes­sage say­ing that my lap­top <span class="small-caps">CPU</span> <span class="push-w"></span><span class="pull-w">w</span>as not sup­ported. No, no, no, lit­tle up­grade as­sis­tant, my<span class="push-A"></span> <span class="pull-A">A</span>cer <span class="small-caps">6935G</span> has Intel<span class="push-C"></span> <span class="pull-C">C</span>ore 2 Duo <span class="small-caps">P8600</span> proces­sor,<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>hich has all the fea­tures you<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ant. <span class="small-caps">PAE</span>,<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>heck. <span class="small-caps">SSE2</span>,<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>heck. <span class="small-caps">NX</span>,<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>heck.<span class="push-W"></span> <span class="pull-W">W</span>hat else do you need?

<p>Frankly speak­ing, I<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as not<span class="push-v"></span> <span class="pull-v">v</span>ery fas­ci­nated<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ith<span class="push-W"></span> <span class="pull-W">W</span>indows 10. Had I stopped right here, I<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ould have much less trou­ble. However, I sim­ply did­n’t (or<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>ould­n’t).<span class="push-T"></span> <span class="pull-T">T</span>o me, this<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as a<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>hal­leng­ing puz­zle and I re­ally en­joyed try­ing to solve it.</p>
<p><span class="pull-O">O</span>ne piece<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>f in­for­ma­tion did give me some in­spi­ra­tion, but it<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as also a trap,<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ell, kind<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>f. It said that <span class="small-caps">NX</span> <span class="push-c"></span><span class="pull-c">c</span>ould have been dis­abled by <span class="small-caps">BIOS</span>, and it might re­quire a <span class="small-caps">BIOS</span> up­date<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>r hack to see the hid­den<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>p­tions. I<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as not sur­prised at all to see that my<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>up-to-date” <span class="small-caps">BIOS</span> did­n’t have that<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>p­tion. Let’s try <span class="small-caps">BIOS</span> hack, I thought.</p>
<p>I<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as lucky to find an<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>ld <a href="https://www.bios-mods.com/forum/Thread-UNLOCKED-ACER-6935G">un­locked<span class="push-v"></span> <span class="pull-v">v</span>er­sion</a> <span class="push-o"></span><span class="pull-o">o</span>f my <span class="small-caps">BIOS</span>. I<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as ex­cited to see the hid­den menu for ad­vanced<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>p­tions, but I did­n’t see an<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>p­tion for <span class="small-caps">NX</span>.<span class="push-A"></span> <span class="pull-A">A</span>s a side find­ing, I saw the<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>p­tion for<span class="push-V"></span> <span class="pull-V">V</span>T-x. I turned it<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>n, but <a href="https://www.grc.com/securable.htm">SecurAble</a> still showed<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span><span class="small-caps">NO</span><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">”</span> for hard­ware<span class="push-v"></span> <span class="pull-v">v</span>ir­tu­al­iza­tion. It seemed that the hid­den menu<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as un­cov­ered, but that<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>p­tion for<span class="push-V"></span> <span class="pull-V">V</span>T-x<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>as not<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ork­ing for some rea­son.</p>
<p>I kept look­ing for<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>ther un­locked<span class="push-v"></span> <span class="pull-v">v</span>er­sions, but I did­n’t find any suit­able<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>ne. I even flashed a<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>rong im­age<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>f <span class="small-caps">BIOS</span>. Guess<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>hat? My lap­top turned into a brick. Not sur­prised at all. Long story short: I had to tear apart the lap­top, des­ol­der the <span class="small-caps">BIOS</span> <span class="push-c"></span><span class="pull-c">c</span>hip, re-pro­gram it, re-sol­der it, and then re­assem­ble the lap­top. Lessons learned: never flash a <span class="small-caps">BIOS</span> im­age if its size is dif­fer­ent than the<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>f­fi­cial<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>ne.</p>
<p><span class="pull-A">A</span> year passed by quickly. Recently, I<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>ame across <a href="https://marcan.st/2009/06/enabling-intel-vt-on-the-aspire-8930g/">this post</a>.

Basically, I dumped<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>ut the run­time <span class="small-caps">BIOS</span> us­ing an Ubuntu Live <span class="small-caps">USB</span> stick, used the script in that post to patch the im­age, and then flash it back (with size<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>heck­ing first,<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>f<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>ourse).<span class="push-T"></span> <span class="pull-T">T</span>his time SecurAble re­ports<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span><span class="small-caps">YES</span><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">”</span> for<span class="push-V"></span> <span class="pull-V">V</span>T-x.
